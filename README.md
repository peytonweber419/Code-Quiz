# Code-Quiz

## Description

I have created a quiz with 5 multiple choice questions pertaining to Javascript. The ideal user of this app would be a student looking to study some basic fundamentals of js.

## Usage

After reading the description click the start button. You will then begin the quiz and see a red timer counting down from 60 seconds on the left side of the page. Every incorrect answer earns you a 10 second decrease in remaining time. Your time is your score so you want to get as many correct answers as possible to have the most remaining time possible. After completing the last question a prompt will appear telling you to enter your initials (first and last; ex: PW) so your score can be stored in local storage. Simply refresh the page after you have completed the quiz to restart and beat your previous scores!
